I. Parts Completed
	- All parts of this assignments were completed

II. Bugs Encountered
	- This program has NO input validation. Inserting a character where an integer is expected will lead to unpredictable results. Perfect input is expected from the user.

III. Run Instructions
	- "make" or "make all"
	- ./TestMatrix
		- Will run the program
	- make clean
		- Will remove main.o and TestMatrix

IV. Input/Output Files
	- Input: n/a
	- Output: n/a

V. Notes
	- I have added additional cout statements in the TestPartX() functions in order to be more verbose about which part is currently being tested.
